#Welcome.

Located in Spokane, Washington, Eternalistic is the design and development studio of Jeremy Caldwell. I specialize in Drupal theming, site development, and design. If it's on the web I can help.

Currently I work as a Senior Web Developer for [Magner Sanborn](http://magnersanborn.com) and am a co-founder at [Notera](http://notera.net). 

I also frequently collaborate with [ThinkShout](http://thinkshout.org), [Brightplum](http://brightplum.com), [Ward Health](http://wardhealth.com), [WebWise Solutions](http://www.webwiseone.com) and more. 

Oh, and I'm [Certified to Rock](http://certifiedtorock.com/u/72964)!
