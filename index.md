Located in Spokane, Washington, Eternalistic Designs is the design and development studio of Jeremy Caldwell. I specialize in Drupal theming, site development, and design. If it's on the web I can help.

Currently I work as a Senior Web Developer for Magner Sanborn and am a co-founder at Notera. I also frequently collaborate with ThinkShout, Brightplum, Ward Health, WebWise Solutions and more. Oh, and I'm Certified to Rock!
