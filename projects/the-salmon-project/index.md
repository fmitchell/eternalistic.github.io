#{{ page.title }}

Working closely with the team at [ThinkShout](http://www.thinkshout.org) I developed a fully responsive Drupal theme. They handled the backend development and I was responsible for turning that markup into a responsive site that works well on as many devices as possible.

Be sure to check out [ThinkShout's full case study](http://thinkshout.com/work/the-salmon-project) on this project for more information.
