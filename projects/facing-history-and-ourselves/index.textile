h1. {{ page.title }}

I worked as a contractor with the team at "ThinkShout":http://www.thinkshout.com for this project. 

They handled building the Drupal site and working with the client get get exactly what they wanted. I took their vision and turned that into a fully responsive site that works on as many devices as possible.

We had mockups to use for reference but they were unfinished and incomplete. I used them as direction for designing and building elements throughout the site and creating a look and feel that was consistent and filled in the gaps in the design as needed.
