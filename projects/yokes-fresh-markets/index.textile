h1. {{ page.title }}

"MagnerSanborn":http://www.magnersanborn.com was contracted to design and develop a fully responsive site for Yoke's to help showcase the Flavor Trail and make products easily accessible and searchable.

I was responsible for meeting with the clients and discovering what their needs were and developing the backend and frontend of the site. They entered every product into their ad each week and I built tools to help speed up that process and used entities so each product would be reusable once entered into the system.
