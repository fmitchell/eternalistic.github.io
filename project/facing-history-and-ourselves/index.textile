h2. About the project

Working closely with the team at ThinkShout I was developed a fully responsive Drupal theme. They handled all the backend development and I was responsible for turning that markup into a responsive site that works well on as many devices as possible.

There were mockups but they were unfinished and incomplete. I used them as direction for designing and building elements throughout the site and creating a look and feel that was consistent as the user navigated through the site.
