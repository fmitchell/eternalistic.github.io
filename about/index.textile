h1. Jeremy Caldwell

p(intro). I have specialized in Drupal development for over seven years and have been developing for the web for 10+ years. My experience in design helps bring a different approach to development and accounts for user experience along the way. This ensures the project is easy to use and allows for future development.

p(intro). I have trained and given presentations at local and regional Drupal user group meetings and continue to train employees internally. I stay current on new technologies and strive to incorporate new development tools and best practices into my workflow.
